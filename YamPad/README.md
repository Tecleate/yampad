This is my attempt to make the zmk firmware for the yampad to make it use nice!nano 2.0 and go wireless

The Yampad project is an open-source, [QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware)](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) powered, hot-swappable, RGB-backlighted, OLED featured, mechanical numpad. 
The Yampad is a Macropad/Numpad which uses Cherry MX style mechanical switches laid out in the usual numeric pad layout. The only difference comes from the bottom row, which uses a 4 keys configuration, thus enabling the use of the macropad as a nav cluster.

Go to [YamPAD by mattdibi for more details](https://github.com/mattdibi/yampad)


I would like to thank [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_urj-rF3bQ) for giving me the courage to go ahead and make it and [caksoylar](https://github.com/caksoylar) for guiding me on pin mapping.


Note: https://deskthority.net/wiki/Arduino_Pro_Micro#Pinout here QMK uses the inner columns with `P*`, ZMK uses the `D*` middle column
